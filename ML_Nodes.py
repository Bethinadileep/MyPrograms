the kernel trick
means without applying the high dimension space we are getting a non linear decision boundary that is called kernel trick
types of kernels
1)Gauusian Kernal
2)Sigmoid Kernel
3)Polynomial Kernel

Non-Linear SVR

Section SVR

Section on Kernel Trick
1)Kernel SVM Intuition
2)Mapping to a higher dimension
3)The Kernel Trick
4)Types of Kernel Functions
5)Non-Linear Kernel SVR

Non Linear SVM
it is caomplex problem we are sovling
Going in to a 3rd Dimensions and doing Hyperplane and getting out our Results.
